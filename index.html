    <h1>Zero to SOLID in 45 Minutes</h1>
    <p>
        This is sample source for the 
        <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GTA-PHP-User-Group-Toronto/events/230656470/">Zero to SOLID in 45 Minutes</a>
        talk for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GTA-PHP-User-Group-Toronto/">GTA-PHP Meetup Group</a>. It
        is a mock implementation of a simple shopping cart.
        Slides are available at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zymsys/zero-to-solid">Slideshare</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code is split into branches for each stage of evolution covered in the talk. It progresses from
        "Zero" which is a sample of what beginner PHP might look like to SOLID, which is object oriented code
        that - at least in some way, follows the principals of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a>. These branches are
        numbered as follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>00: "Zero" - no classes, not even a function defined.</li>
        <li>01: Code moved into functions</li>
        <li>02: Functions moved into a "god" object</li>
        <li>03: SRP - class split into responsibilities</li>
        <li>04: OCP - classes modified to encourage extension without modification</li>
        <li>05: LSP - gave up on a code example. Too contrived. No such branch.</li>
        <li>06: DIP - dependance on concrete classes changed to interfaces</li>
        <li>07: ISP - interface(s) divided to be client specific</li>
    </ul>
